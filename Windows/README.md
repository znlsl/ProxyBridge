## Installation

1. Download the latest `ProxyBridge-Setup-X.X.X.exe` from the [Releases](https://github.com/InterceptSuite/ProxyBridge/releases) page
2. Run the installer with Administrator privileges
3. The installer will:
   - Install ProxyBridge to `C:\Program Files\ProxyBridge`
   - Add the install directory to your system PATH (GUI, CLI, and DLL all accessible)
   - Create Start Menu shortcuts for the GUI application
   - Include all required dependencies (WinDivert driver)




## Usage

### GUI Application

Launch `ProxyBridge.exe` with Administrator privileges for an intuitive graphical interface.

#### Proxy Settings

<p align="center">
  <img src="../img/proxy-setting.png" alt="Proxy Settings" width="600"/>
</p>

1. Click **Proxy** tab in the main window
2. Click **Proxy Settings** from the menu
3. Select **Proxy Type** (SOCKS5 or HTTP)
4. Enter **Proxy Host** - supports both IP addresses and domain names:
   - IP Address: `127.0.0.1`, `192.168.1.100`
   - Domain Name: `proxy.example.com`, `localhost`
5. Enter **Proxy Port** (e.g., 1080 for SOCKS5, 8080 for HTTP)
6. (Optional) Enter **Proxy Username** and **Proxy Password** for authenticated proxies
7. Click **Save Changes**

**Test Proxy Connection:**
1. Click **Test Proxy Connection** button
2. Enter **Destination IP/Host** (default: google.com)
3. Enter **Destination Port** (default: 80)
4. Click **Start Test** to verify proxy connectivity

#### Multiple Proxy Configurations

ProxyBridge supports multiple proxy server configurations simultaneously. Each proxy rule can be assigned to a specific proxy configuration, allowing you to route different applications through different proxies at the same time.

- Add multiple proxy servers (SOCKS5 and HTTP, mixed) in **Proxy Settings**
- Each proxy entry gets a unique ID
- When creating a **Proxy Rule**, select which proxy configuration to route through via the **Proxy Config** selector
- If a rule's assigned proxy config is not found, ProxyBridge falls back to the first available configuration

**Example use cases:**
- Route `chrome.exe` through a SOCKS5 proxy and `curl.exe` through an HTTP proxy simultaneously
- Test against multiple proxy endpoints without restarting
- Assign latency-sensitive apps to a local proxy and others to a remote one

#### Process Rules

</p>

<p align="center">
  <img src="../img/proxy-rule2.png" alt="Process Rules List" width="600"/>
</p>

1. Click **Proxy** tab in the main window
2. Click **Proxy Rules** from the menu
3. Configure rule parameters:

   **Applications:**
   - Use `*` as wildcard for all processes
   - Enter single process: `chrome.exe`
   - Enter multiple processes (semicolon-separated): `firefox.exe; chrome.exe`
   - Use **Browse** button to select a process executable

   **Target Hosts (Optional):**
   - Specific IP: `192.168.1.1`
   - Wildcard IP range: `192.168.*.*`
   - Multiple IPs: `127.0.0.1; 192.168.1.1`
   - IP range: `10.10.1.1-10.10.255.255`
   - IPv6 exact: `::1`, `2001:db8::1`
   - IPv6 CIDR: `2001:db8::/32`, `fe80::/10`
   - IPv6 range: `2001:db8::1-2001:db8::ff`
   - Leave empty or use `*` for all hosts

   **Target Ports (Optional):**
   - Specific ports: `80; 8080`
   - Port range: `80-8000`
   - Leave empty or use `*` for all ports

   **Protocol:**
   - Select **TCP**, **UDP**, or **Both (TCP + UDP)**

   **Action:**
   - **PROXY** - Route through the selected proxy configuration
   - **DIRECT** - Allow direct internet access
   - **BLOCK** - Block all internet access

4. Click **Save Rule** to apply

#### Exporting and Importing Rules

ProxyBridge allows you to export selected rules to a `.pbprofile` JSON file and import rules from previously exported files.

**Export Rules:**
1. In the **Proxy Rules** window, select one or more rules using the checkboxes
2. Click the **Export** button
3. Choose a location and save the file (`.pbprofile`)

**Import Rules:**
1. Click the **Import** button
2. Select a previously exported `.pbprofile` file
3. Rules and proxy configurations are imported and merged with existing settings

**Profile JSON Format:**
```json
{
  "Version": "1.0",
  "LocalhostViaProxy": false,
  "IsTrafficLoggingEnabled": true,
  "ProxyConfigs": [
    {
      "Id": 1,
      "Type": "socks5",
      "Host": "127.0.0.1",
      "Port": "1080",
      "Username": "",
      "Password": ""
    },
    {
      "Id": 2,
      "Type": "http",
      "Host": "127.0.0.1",
      "Port": "8080",
      "Username": "",
      "Password": ""
    }
  ],
  "ProxyRules": [
    {
      "ProcessName": "chrome.exe",
      "TargetHosts": "*",
      "TargetPorts": "*",
      "Protocol": "TCP",
      "Action": "PROXY",
      "IsEnabled": true,
      "ProxyConfigId": 1
    },
    {
      "ProcessName": "firefox.exe",
      "TargetHosts": "192.168.*.*",
      "TargetPorts": "80;443",
      "Protocol": "BOTH",
      "Action": "PROXY",
      "IsEnabled": true,
      "ProxyConfigId": 2
    }
  ]
}
```

**Note:** The `.pbprofile` format is cross-platform - profiles exported from macOS can be imported on Windows and vice versa.

#### Activity Monitoring

<p align="center">
  <img src="../img/ProxyBridge.png" alt="Active Connections" width="600"/>
</p>

- View real-time connection activity in the **Connections** tab
- Monitor all TCP and UDP connections system-wide
- See routing status per connection: **PROXY**, **DIRECT**, or **BLOCK**
- Search and filter by process name, IP, port, or routing status

**Note:** Adding a rule with action **PROXY** while no proxy is configured will fall back to a direct connection. Configure at least one proxy server before using PROXY rules.

### Command Line Interface (CLI)

`ProxyBridge_CLI.exe` is a lightweight native CLI that loads a `.pbprofile` exported from the GUI and runs ProxyBridge headlessly - no GUI required.

#### Profile Format

The CLI reads `.pbprofile` files exported directly from the GUI (**File → Export Profile**). These are JSON files containing proxy server configurations and routing rules. See the [Profile JSON Format](#exporting-and-importing-rules) section above for the schema.

**Key profile fields read by the CLI:**

| Field | Description |
|---|---|
| `ProxyConfigs[]` | Array of proxy servers (SOCKS5 or HTTP, up to 16) |
| `ProxyRules[]` | Array of routing rules (up to 256) |
| `LocalhostViaProxy` | Whether to route `127.x.x.x` traffic through the proxy |
| `IsTrafficLoggingEnabled` | Enable/disable connection logging |
| `ProxyConfigId` | Per-rule proxy assignment (maps to `ProxyConfigs[].Id`) |

#### Basic Usage

```powershell
# Run a profile (requires Administrator)
ProxyBridge_CLI.exe --profile C:\Users\user\myconfig.pbprofile

# Run with connection logging
ProxyBridge_CLI.exe --profile myconfig.pbprofile --verbose 2

# Run with full log and connection output
ProxyBridge_CLI.exe --profile myconfig.pbprofile --verbose 3

# Check for updates (does not require Administrator)
ProxyBridge_CLI.exe --update

# Show version
ProxyBridge_CLI.exe --version

# Show help
ProxyBridge_CLI.exe --help
```

**Notes:**
- `--profile` requires Administrator (WinDivert kernel driver)
- `--update` and `--version` do not require Administrator
- Press `Ctrl+C` to stop ProxyBridge cleanly
- The CLI and `ProxyBridgeCore.dll` must be in the same directory

## Use Cases

- Redirect proxy-unaware applications (games, desktop apps) through InterceptSuite/Burp Suite for security testing
- Route specific applications through Tor, SOCKS5, or HTTP proxies
- Intercept and analyze traffic from applications that don't support proxy configuration
- Route different applications through different proxy servers simultaneously
- Test application behavior under different network conditions
- Analyze IPv4 and IPv6 protocols and communication patterns



## Things to Note

- **Localhost Traffic Handling**: Localhost traffic (`127.0.0.0/8` and IPv6 `::1`) requires special handling and is controlled by the **Localhost via Proxy** option in the Proxy menu (disabled by default):

  **Default Behavior (Localhost via Proxy = Disabled):**
  - ALL localhost traffic automatically uses direct connection
  - Proxy rules matching `127.x.x.x` or `::1` addresses are automatically overridden to DIRECT
  - This is the recommended setting for most users

  **Why localhost should stay local:**
  - **Security**: Most proxy servers reject localhost traffic to prevent SSRF (Server-Side Request Forgery) attacks
  - **Compatibility**: Many applications run local services that must stay on your machine:
    - NVIDIA GeForce Experience (local API servers)
    - Chrome/Edge DevTools (`127.0.0.1:9222` debugging protocol)
    - Development servers (localhost web/database servers)
    - Inter-process communication (IPC) using TCP/UDP on `127.0.0.1`
  - **Routing Issues**: When localhost traffic goes to a remote proxy, the proxy server cannot reach services running on YOUR machine

  **When to Enable Localhost via Proxy:**
  - ✅ Proxy server is running on the same machine (`127.0.0.1:1080`)
  - ✅ Security testing: Intercepting localhost traffic in Burp Suite/InterceptSuite
  - ✅ Your proxy is configured to handle localhost requests properly
  - ❌ Do NOT enable if proxy is on a different machine/IP address

  **CLI:** Controlled via the `LocalhostViaProxy` field in the `.pbprofile` file.

- **Automatic Direct Routing**: Certain addresses and ports always bypass proxy rules and use direct connection to preserve network stability:

  **IPv4:**
  - **Broadcast** (`255.255.255.255` and `x.x.x.255`) - Network broadcast
  - **Multicast** (`224.0.0.0–239.255.255.255`) - Group communication
  - **APIPA / Link-local** (`169.254.0.0/16`) - Automatic Private IP Addressing
  - **DHCP ports** (UDP 67, 68) - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol

  **IPv6:**
  - **Multicast** (`FF00::/8`) - Replaces IPv4 broadcast entirely; includes DHCPv6 multicast (`FF02::1:2`), all-nodes (`FF02::1`), router solicitation, etc.
  - **Link-local** (`FE80::/10`) - Cannot be routed off-link; equivalent to IPv4 APIPA
  - **Site-local (deprecated)** (`FEC0::/10`) - Still seen on older equipment
  - **Unspecified** (`::`) - Equivalent to IPv4 `0.0.0.0`
  - **DHCPv6 ports** (UDP 546, 547) - Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol for IPv6

  You can still create rules with **DIRECT** or **BLOCK** actions targeting these addresses/ports to explicitly log or block such traffic, but **PROXY** is always overridden to **DIRECT** for them.

- **IPv6 Support**: ProxyBridge fully supports IPv6 traffic interception and routing for both TCP and UDP. IPv6 rules use the same format as IPv4 with additional notation:
  - Exact address: `::1`, `2001:db8::1`
  - CIDR: `2001:db8::/32`, `fe80::/10`
  - Range: `2001:db8::1-2001:db8::ff`
  - Wildcard `*` matches all IPv4 and IPv6 addresses

- **UDP Proxy Requirements**: UDP traffic only works when a SOCKS5 proxy is configured. HTTP proxies cannot relay UDP traffic - ProxyBridge will automatically fall back to direct for UDP when only an HTTP proxy is configured.

  **Important UDP Considerations**:
  - Most SOCKS5 proxies do not support UDP ASSOCIATE (including SSH SOCKS5 tunnels)
  - The SOCKS5 proxy must support the UDP ASSOCIATE command
  - Many UDP applications use HTTP/3 and DTLS protocols - ensure your proxy handles these
  - **Testing**: Try [Nexus Proxy](https://github.com/InterceptSuite/nexus-proxy) to test ProxyBridge UDP/HTTP3/DTLS support

- **Multiple Proxy Configurations**: Up to 16 proxy server configurations can be active simultaneously. Rules can each be assigned to a specific proxy config. If the assigned config is not found, ProxyBridge falls back to the first available config. This allows routing different apps through different proxies without any application-side configuration.

## How It Works

ProxyBridge use Windivert to inspect all TCP/UDP packets and use rules from user to perform action on them

Case 1: Packet does not match any rules

<p align="center">
  <img src="../img/flow1.png" alt="flow" width="600"/>
</p>


Case 2: Packet match with proxy rule


<p align="center">
  <img src="../img/flow.png" alt="flow" width="600"/>
</p>

**Traffic Flow:**
1. **Applications Generate Traffic** - User-mode applications (Chrome, Discord, Games, Services) create TCP/UDP packets
2. **Kernel Interception** - WinDivert.sys driver intercepts ALL outbound packets at kernel level
3. **User-Mode Delivery** - WinDivert.dll receives intercepted packets and delivers them to ProxyBridge
4. **Rule Evaluation** - ProxyBridge inspects each packet and applies configured rules:
   - **BLOCK** → Packet is dropped (no network access)
   - **DIRECT** → Packet is re-injected unchanged (direct connection)
   - **NO MATCH** → Packet is re-injected unchanged (direct connection)
   - **PROXY** → Packet destination is modified to TCP/UDP relay servers (34010/34011)
5. **Proxy Processing** - For PROXY-matched packets:
   - Relay servers store original destination IP and port
   - Convert raw TCP/UDP to SOCKS5/HTTP proxy protocol
   - Perform proxy authentication and forward to proxy server
6. **Proxy Forwarding** - Proxy server (Burp Suite/InterceptSuite) forwards traffic to original destination
7. **Response Handling** - Return traffic flows back through relay servers, which restore original source IP/port before re-injection

**Key Points:**
- All packet manipulation happens transparently - applications remain completely unaware
- WinDivert operates at kernel level for reliable interception before packets reach the network
- ProxyBridge rule engine provides granular control over which traffic gets proxied
- TCP/UDP relay servers handle protocol conversion between raw sockets and proxy protocols
